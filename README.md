## Recommended way to get started quickly

Install [http-server](https://www.npmjs.com/package/http-server) globally:
```
npm install http-server -g
```

Go into the public folder and run the project:
```
cd public

http-server
```

It starts a local server from the project folder in port 8080

Go to `http://localhost:8080/`
